# maze-game
Year 2 assignment for Object Oriented C++ module.
The aim of the project was to create a console based maze game that implements a maze using objects and pointers.
The program reads predefined maze structure from a text file and assigns it to a previously created linked list. 
To ensure high playability and good flow of the program as well as a possibility of re-playing the game, a simple State Machine was implemented where the states consist of: Initialize, Running, Win and Quit.
